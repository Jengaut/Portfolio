            <p>I am Jennifer Gauthier, a 28-year-old graphic designer in career
                transition. After several years of experience in prepress,
                I decided to pursue training in web development due to my interest in
                website reproduction during my vocational training in graphic design.
                Today, I am happy to apply my graphic design skills to the creation of
                innovative websites, and I am constantly seeking new challenges
                to improve my abilities.
                </br>
                </br>
                As a web developer, I have gained experience in programming using
                Visual Studio Code and primarily working with languages such as
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. My experience in web
                development has also extended to WordPress, which I used during my
                vocational training in graphic design, as well as creating a plug-in
                as part of a team project during my AEC. The plug-in design involved
                the use of project management tools such as Trello, which contributed to
                effective collaboration among team members and the project's success.
